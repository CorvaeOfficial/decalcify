# DeCalcify, a Corvae Labs App

## ABOUT

The goal of DeCalcify is to analyze and understand oneself's behavior and tendancies.
This is accomplished via recording of events in Google Calendar and analysis of the events over time.
To use this, one must do the following:
1. Record meaningful items in their Google Calendar with accurate start/stop times.
2. Run the DeCalcify app.

The reports generated by DeCalcify are only as good as the information put into them.
Finding the take-away  is the subjective next-step once a report is generated.
With good use of this app, you'll increase self-awareness and be equiped with 
information and data to make actionable decisions to improve your life.
